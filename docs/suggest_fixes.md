**Claim #5:**

1️⃣ Rephrased: Studies show generative AI can increase creativity but may lead to more similar student outputs in education.

2️⃣ Source: “The Impact of Generative AI on Critical Thinking” (microsoft.com / dl.acm.org / nature.com)

3️⃣ Reason: References empirical studies examining both diversity and novelty, making the claim more specific and grounded in research.

1️⃣ Rephrased: Research finds mixed effects of AI use on student creativity and collective response novelty.

2️⃣ Source: “How does generative artificial intelligence impact student creative thinking skills?” (ScienceDirect)

3️⃣ Reason: Citing a study with measurable outcomes and peer review directly supports both positive and negative effects.

1️⃣ Rephrased: Multiple studies link GenAI usage competence and AI self-efficacy to changes in student creativity and critical thinking.

2️⃣ Source: “The Chain Mediating Role of Critical Thinking and AI Self-Efficacy” (nature.com)

3️⃣ Reason: Framing the claim around established mediators clarifies mechanisms and adds evidence from large, multi-site datasets.

For all other claims: No change needed.
