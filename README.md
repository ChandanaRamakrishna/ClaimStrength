# ClaimStrength
AI-powered claim verification assistant built with Perplexity Comet

🚀 ClaimStrength – AI-Powered Claim Verification Assistant
Built for the Build with Perplexity Comet Hackathon (2025)

👩‍💻 Solo Project by Chandana R

📌 Overview

ClaimStrength is an AI-powered assistant that extracts claims, checks evidence, verifies truthfulness, and strengthens academic writing — in under 30 seconds.

Powered by Perplexity Comet’s agentic browsing, it transforms academic writing by automatically validating statements using high-quality sources, detecting contradictions, and generating rewritten, citation-ready claims.

✨ Key Features

🔍 Claim Extraction

Identifies 5–8 factual or argumentative statements from any essay or PDF.

🤖 Truthfulness Verification (Comet Agentic Browsing)

Finds supporting OR contradicting evidence from academic sources.

Rates each claim’s evidence strength: Strong / Moderate / Weak.

⚠️ Contradiction Detection

Highlights conflicting research from multiple sources.

✍️ Smart Rewrites

Suggests clearer, stronger, academically accurate rewrites.

📚 Citation Generation

Produces APA-formatted citations for every validated claim.

🗺️ Evidence Map Visualization

Shows how claims connect to supporting/contradicting sources.

📊 Metrics Dashboard

Displays evidence distribution, contradictions, and confidence scores.

🧠 Why ClaimStrength?

✔️ 15× faster than manual fact-checking
✔️ Built directly on Perplexity Comet agentic workflows
✔️ Designed for students, teachers, and researchers
✔️ Ensures academic integrity and reduces misinformation

🏗️ System Architecture 

1.User Input Layer

User uploads a PDF or pastes text (essay, paragraph, research paper).

Input is preprocessed (cleaning, formatting).

2.Claim Extraction Module

Identifies 5–8 factual or argumentative statements.

Filters out irrelevant text (background, definitions, citations).

3.Comet Agentic Retrieval Layer

Each claim is checked using Perplexity Comet.

Comet autonomously:

Searches the web

Finds academic sources

Follows citation chains

Evaluates factuality

Evidence Analysis Layer

Extracts supporting & contradicting sources.

4.Scores evidence strength:

Strong

Moderate

Weak

5.Detects contradictions.

Rewrite & Citation Generator

Produces clearer, stronger rewritten claims.

Generates APA-style citations for verified evidence.

6.Visualization Layer

Builds:

Evidence Map

Claim→Source graph

Metrics Dashboard (confidence, contradictions, strength)

7.Output Layer

Delivers a final structured report with:

Extracted claims

Evidence scoring

Contradictions

Rewrites

APA citations

Visualization PNGs
